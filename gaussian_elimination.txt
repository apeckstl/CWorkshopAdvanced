Gaussian Elimination
Challenge adapted from professor Zhiling Lan's CS451 course.

Your task is to generate a system of linear equations with N unknowns, (N is either default or provided by the user), and use Gaussian elimination to solve the system. You will need to complete the following tasks:

1. Learn how to use srand() to generate a random number. (bonus: can you find a way to make the random numbers deterministic so you can test?)

2. Use malloc() or calloc() to allocate space for the NxN matrix A, and space for the output Nx1 vector B, and your eventual Nx1 solution vector x.

3. Write a printProblem() function that displays your randomly generated problem.

4. Perform the elimination algorithm to do the first step of elimination.

5. Perform back-substitution to normalize the diagonal elements to 1.

6. Solve for each x in the output vector.

7. Print your solution

Resources:
The Wikipedia article on Gaussian elimination is really helpful and contains pseudocode: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination

Tips:
If you're stuck, look up a solution in Python or another language to get ideas on the algorithm, then try to implement in C.

Extra ideas:
Can you time your program to see how long it takes to run different sizes of systems? Try N=10, N=100, N=1000
Can you print your system at different stages of execution to check its accuracy?
